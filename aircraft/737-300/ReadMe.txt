This is the 737-300 in Progress and under GNU GPL v2.0

The work is based on the work of David Culp (FDM) and Innis Cunningham (3d-model)


The Boeing 737-300 was under work to be improved and to come much closer to realitity, but is more or less abandoned now.

Authors:

3d-model: Heiko Schulz, Innis Cunningham
3d-cockpit: Heiko Schulz, some parts from Ispana FlightGear Team

For seeing the 3d-cockpit in progress pan the view so the 2d-panel will dissapear

To-Do:
___________
-Clean-up mesh! Reduce number of materials, remove unneeded vertices and edges with keeping UVmap.
-adding shader for lights and reflection/specular effects
-a proper flightdeck- the used approach wasn't good and effective
-more realistic Autoflightsystem: the 733 has the same basic features like 777, so this one could be simply adapted
-making it compatible with Rembrandt
