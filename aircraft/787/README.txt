Some more info about the 787 and this model:

At the time of writing, the 787 is not in commercial service. It is still undergoing testing and
certification up in Seattle. Because of this, final flight characteristics and manuals are not
available because they simply have not been made yet.

When I first looked at this aircraft, I was surprised at how easily I could fly it. It could take off
and land on really short runways, obviously not very realistic. There were many reasons for this,
many because the FDM seemed to be a slightly modified version of the 777-200ER's FDM.

I started to make the FDM more realistic, but generally did nothing to the model itself except for
adding some effects, like gear smoke, contrails, and the tailstrike effects. With help from members
of the FlightGear forums, I was able to fiddle with certain characteristics to make the aircraft more
realistic. Thanks to dany93 for getting some data on the 787, which was about some approach speed data.

There are still many modeling aspects of the plane left to be done. The 3D model doesn't represent
the 787, most obviously, the engine cowlings, which should be tapered more. The cockpit is basically
a recolored 777 panel. There is still much to be done. I have began the slow work on the cockpit,
but it will take a long time.

If you'd like to contact me about the project or look to join the project somehow, contact me at the
places below. I'm pretty open to people helping out the project.
