A-6E (YASim) readme.



History
-------


Model
-----
The model is based on Vivian Mezza's original KA6-D.ac.




Flight Data Model
-----------------
The Flight Data Model uses the FlightGear YASim fdm solver, which
uses a combination of aircraft geometry and performance data to
generate the flight model.
A automaticaly movable ballast (wich doesn't exist in reality)
helps getting a smoother pitch at high speeds (fwd CG) and permit
high AoA flight at very low speed (aft CG).
