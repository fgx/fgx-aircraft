FDM and upgrade to 2.0 standards: Nick I

There have been many changes from the initial release of the CRJ-200 to this one right here. The old
version barely worked with 2.0, and now this one is fully compatible. This current release also has a
MUCH better FDM than the old one. It still needs some real-life performance data to match it to, but 
it provides a more realistic flying experience than before. 

This release was centered on getting ready for the front page. There is still development going on.

If you want to contact me about something about the CRJ-200, you can use the forums under username
"nickyivyca" or email me at nickyivyca [at] yahoo [dot] com. More liveries and a paintkit for making
liveries should be available at liveries.flightgear.org under the CRJ-200 section. This includes a 
.xcf template, light instructions, and also a wanted list for liveries, as of writing, wanted but not
available.
