Concorde ops
============
Takeoff
-------
- the visor is raised not long after takeoff, to make cockpit quieter (A1).
- the visor protects the windscreen from the 125 degC temperature at Mach 2 (A1).

Subsonic cruise
---------------
- Mach 0.93 at FL250, or Mach 0.95 at FL260 (full load) (B).

Supersonic climb
----------------
- start afterburner with VS at 3500 ft/minute; then progressively decrease until 700 ft/minute.
- climb with full throttle.
- at Mach 1.1, drag starts to decrease : prepare to increase the climb rate.
- stay inside the corridor of Mach/center of gravity. Below the minimum means a too high altitude
  for the current Mach speed : accelerate by reducing climb speed.
- at Mach 1.3, air intakes open progressively, providing additional thrust : prepare to increase
  the climb rate.
- climb from Mach 0.95 (28000 ft) to Mach 1.7 (47000 ft) lasts 10 minutes (A2).

Supersonic cruise
-----------------
- from London-Heathrow, Mach 2 is reached 40 minutes - 650 NM (Bristol Channel) - after takeoff (A3).
- cruise at Mach 2 consumes 20.5 tons/hour (E).
- transatlantic flight at Mach 2 lasts 2 hours; 2h35 above Mach 1 (A4).
- at FL500 Mach 2, slow climb rate of 50-60 ft/minute, to reduce fuel consumption (A3).

Supersonic descent
------------------
- decelerate speed until 325-380 kt before starting the descent (B).
- deceleration is started at 250 NM : 165 NM from Mach 2.0 FL580 to Mach 1.0 at FL350 (A3).
- maintain the 50 ft climb rate to accelerate the deceleration.
- maintain the 325-380 kt speed during the descent.

Landing
-------
- approach speed : 190 kt (A1).
- at 750 ft AGL, disable autopilot and autothrottle, keep the trim of the glide slope mode;
  maintain pitch at 10 degrees, control descent rate with speed (throttle).
- the tail wheel protects the reversers from hitting the ground (A1).
- avoid autoland by gusty wind.


Installation
============
A mouse with 3rd (middle) button, or its emulation (left + right button), is required.

Mouse
=====
The 3rd button of mouse :
- pushes a button, when 1st button turns it. Example : track / heading.
- toggles a less used 3rd state. Example : gear neutral, emergency switch.

Autopilot
---------
- avoid default autopilot setting (F10 key), use 2D panel or 3D cockpit.
- before pressing "TH" (track/heading), select "HDG" magnetic heading, or "TRK" true heading,
  with mouse 3rd button.
- "HH" (heading hold) is always magnetic.
- "CL" (max climb) sets the autothrottle to VMO (MMO above 50200 ft), and holds pitch.
- "AA" (altitude acquire) works by capture : the target altitude is reached by another
   altitude mode, "CL", "PH" or "VS".
- see Panels/Concorde-autopilot.xml (list of all buttons).

Electrical
----------
- autopilots and a few instruments depend of a particular ACC ESS BUS.

Engine
------
- to start an engine, activate the starter, before opening the HP VALVE (overhead).
  The starter requires air bleed, either from the ground service (open 1 cross bleed valve),
  or by its adjacent running engine (open 2 cross bleed valve).
- the starter requires AC voltage, from the ground supply ("ctrl-I g").
- the starter is not required in flight (relight), if enough speed :
  relight is automatic, when autoignition is on (overhead).

Fuel
----
Use virtual engineer (or 2D panel) to start :
- the collector tanks 1 2 3 4 feed respectively engines 1 2 3 4.
- the main tanks 5 7 feed the collector tanks.

Hydraulics
----------
- nose, gear, brakes depend of green and yellow (standby) circuits.
- ground pumps require ground electrical power.

Radio
-----
- only "ctrl-R" or "ctrl-I r" : NAV 0 (default radio menu) is reserved for interface with autopilot.


2D panel
========
The 2D Panel has simplified buttons for :
- fuel transfers (inlet valves are automatically opened).
- engine start (voltage and air bleed are not required).

Fuel
----
- "Aft" transfers forwards trim tanks (9, 10) to aft trim tanks (11).
- "Forward" does the reverse transfer (only to 9).
- "Engine" transfers trim tanks to the main tanks (5, 7) : choose the direction "Aft" or "Forw".
- the transfert valve feeds a main tank (5, 7) by its auxilliary tank (5A, 7A);
- "Jettison" (2 buttons for confirmation) dumps the trim (9, 10, 11) and collector tanks
  (1, 2, 3, 4) : isolate a trim tank by stopping its fuel pumps. 
- activate "Cross", to balance the dissymetrical tanks.


Virtual crew
============
- the virtual crew operates parallely to the voice callouts.
- a green crew member is performing his checklist.
- a yellow crew member is not performing his checklist.
- a white checklist is in process.
- by default, virtual crew triggers checklists, if in flight :
  for manual operation, press "ctrl-I p s".
- by default, virtual crew adjusts radio frequencies, if tower available in Nasal/Concorde-route.xml :
  for manual operation, press "ctrl-I p s".

3D
--
- to activate 3D, press "ctrl-I c".

Captain
-------
- by default, Captain tasks are performed automatically :
  his answers are yellow.
- for call by the crew member reading the checklist, press "ctrl-I p s".

Copilot
-------
- his calls are green.
- the copilot is pilot in command, only during 4 engines flameout,
  where he holds the aircraft during engine start.

Engineer
-------
- his calls are blue.
- center of gravity is ajusted without checklist.

Consumption
===========
Consumption decreases with altitude, from FL500 to FL580 (60 ft/min. during 2h10).
Fuel must be just below 19000 kg with the direct route (short SID/STAR).
So that it remains enough fuel, in case the SID/STAR becomes long :
STAR at KJFK seems to have been always short (range edge).

Route
-----
East bound :
- acceleration 30 NM before MERLY.
- deceleration 250 NM before LINND or LYNUS.

West bound :
- acceleration at LINND.
- deceleration 40 NM after BANDU (BARIX missing).

KJFK 22L - EGLL 27R, 3150 NM.
EGLL 09R - KJFK 04L, 3300 NM.
LFPG 08L - KJFK 04L, 3500 NM.
LFPG 26L - KJFK 22L, 3550 NM.
TBPB 09  - EGLL 27R, 3700 NM (Barbados).

Example
-------
EGLL 27L - KJFK 22L, 3400 NM :
- load the flight plan from the Doc directory.
- acceleration 30 NM before MERLY.
- stable at FL500 with 71500 kg, 2h20 from LINND, at 2700 NM and 11500 kg (see "ctrl-I n").
- warm, 275 deg 5 kt westerly, Mach 2.02, climbing slowly until 57600 ft (60 ft/min 2h07).
- deceleration 250 NM (13 minutes) before LINND : INS indicates 20900 kg at LINND,
  and 15700 kg at KJFK (590 NM).
- 8500 kg at landing.

Cruise
------
85000 kg (full) at Mach 0.95 (550 kt true) FL260, stable : 23600 kg/h.
71000 kg at Mach 1.99 50000 ft, stable : 26300 kg/h.
69000 kg at Mach 2.02 50300 ft, climb 60 ft/min : 26200 kg/h.
Average (depends of altitude) at Mach 2.02 : 20500 kg/h.
26000 kg at Mach 2.02 57800 ft, stable : 17700 kg/h.
25000 kg at Mach 2.02 57800 ft, climb 60 ft/min : 18100 kg/h.
19000 kg at Mach 0.95 (510 kt true) FL380, stable : 13900 kg/h. 

Decreasing the TSFC increases the range.


JSBSim
======
- maximum thrust (without air intakes) at FL500 is 10093 lb, matching the real value of 10000 lb !
- center of gravity inside corridor.
- shift of center or pressure.
- geometry is real data.
- tanks default at maximum takeoff weight (408000 lb).
- consumption London - New York : correct landing weight at KJFK.
- climb Mach 0.95 - 1.7 in 10 minutes.
- fuel around 20500 kg/h at Mach 2.02 (E).
- intake failure (4 at once).
- weaker supersonic lift.


TO DO
=====
- battery discharge.
- replace AC3D groups by XML groups.

TO DO instruments
-----------------
- control of 2D instrument luminosity (only possible with 3D instruments).
- see Panels/Instruments/ReadmeInstruments.txt

TO FDM
-------
- reduce drag during subsonic climb.
- inertia of surfaces.
- move autopilot PID inside the FDM ?
- additional drag when RAT.
- alteration of FDM by icing.
- check the subsonic range.
- turbulence filter.

FDM update often implies a tuning of autopilot (mainly heading hold),
and always a complete test (autoland, subsonic, supersonic).

TO DO JSBSim
------------
- failure on only 1 intake at once.


Known problems
==============
- data are not saved on reinit.

Known problems autopilot
------------------------
- toggle INS mode, only AFTER activation of route, or use "ctrl-I a".
- NAV hold mode is sensitive to the turbulence of the ground layer.
- heading modes are a little slow to converge, at supersonic speed.

Known problems 2.4.0 autopilot
------------------------------
- on engagement, magnetic and true heading modes bank into the opposite direction.

Known problems autoland
-----------------------
- nav must be accurate until 0 ft AGL : KSFO 28R, RJAA 34L are correct;
  but EGLL 27R, KJFK 22L are wrong : to land at these airports,
  set /controls/autoflight/real-nav to false, by "ctrl-I a".

Known problems sound
--------------------
- ATIS volume (VHF) changed only at the frequency swap.

Known problems OSG
------------------
The following artefacts are supposed to be solved by OSG :
- panels swaping too early.
- instrument transparent through layer with alpha (steward view).
- transparency order of blinking anti-collision light over wing.


Secondary problems
==================
- AI doesn't triggers fuel transfert of tanks 5, if tanks are interconnected.
- if brakes, gear and nose don't work, see Nasal/Concorde-override.nas.

Secondary problems FDM
-----------------------
- very light waddling at mach 2 (autopilot rudder trim, to solve roll of autopilot heading
  at Mach speeds).
- disable yaw damper, when turbulence ?
- oil pressure too high.

Secondary problems JSBSim
-------------------------
- AoA at 180 deg, when one breaks strongly (empty tanks).

Secondary problems instruments
----------------------------
- red brake warnings may light abnormally (XML bug ?).

Secondary problems sound
------------------------
- VHF volume not implemented for Festival (possible ?).
- engineer uses pilot voice.
