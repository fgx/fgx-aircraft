INTRODUCTION
"The Mosquito is one of the worlds lightest manned Helicopters that has been 
designed and developed over the past 10 years to deliver performance, reliability 
and ease of flight. Ken Armstrong of Kit Planes Magazine said that the "Mosquito is 
convincing - it's as close as you can come to real flying with almost no means of 
support, and the view is at least as good as a bird". He also said that "Flying the 
refined Mosquito was the most fun I've ever had with a Helicopter!"."

"Mosquito XE is the same aircraft, but the open frame tubing has been replaced 
with an all fiberglass closed in design."
