Here is the basic flyable models.
Both variants are available

BlackBird-SR71-A was the usual  Aircraft, with Pilot and RSO, you can launch it with:      fg --aircraft=Blackbird-A
BlackBird-SR71-B was the training  Aircrfat, with Instructor Pilot and Student Pilot,  you can launch it with:      fg --aircraft=Blackbird-B

Mainly to be done:
--------A lot (huge)  of improvement regarding the FDM, Aero and Engine performance.
--------Cockpits with more instrumentation.
