This is an enhanced version of the FlightGear T-37 model.

CHANGES

Exterior model
- Completely remodeled canopy, central fuselage area, and tail
- Wing completely redesigned based on published specs (airfoil, dimensions)
- Fully animated retracting landing gear with wheel covers and wells
- Engine fans visible in ducts (not rotating though)
- Ventral fin
- Canopy reflection shader (easy eye candy)
- Canopy frame modeled as separate object ready to be animated.
- Air brake modeled as separate object ready to be animated.


Interior model
- Completely remodeled to more accurately represent spacial relation of pilot, instrument panel, controls, etc.
- Basic flight instruments (these are just a temporary stand-in, and some of them don't work...)
- Pilot and student figures (both can be turned on or off from menu)

Texture
- Full texture map with livery support. Two liveries provided: USAF and Pakistan Air Force "Sherdils" aerobatic team.

Sound
- Engine sound is attenuated when in the cockpit

Other
- Standard Heads-Up Display
- Splash Screen
- Model renamed from t37 to T-37. I did this in the hope that modelers will standardize on filenames that more accurately match the official designation of the aircraft.
