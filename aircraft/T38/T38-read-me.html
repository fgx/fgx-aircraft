<H3>Overview</H3>
This is a first attempt at using a single archive to distribute all the
files needed to model an aircraft in FlightGear. This archive should be
extracted into directory $FGROOT/Aircraft/T38.  The engine file will then need to be moved
to the $FGROOT/Engine directory.  Eventually FlightGear will be able to keep all the files for an
airplane in one directory.

<H3>Bugs</H3>
I'm still fairly new to FlightGear, so some of these "bugs" may actually
be features :)

 <TH WIDTH=40%>bug</TH>

</TR>
<TR>
 <TD>3D model has some bugs</TD>
 <TD>The model is a reskinned version of the Captain Slug AT-38, with modifications by Innis Cunningham,
  who converted the model from MDL to AC3D format and added animations and a cockpit.
  There are missing gear doors. It could use gear sequencing.  Some texture missing from aft
  fuselage. 
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
 <TD>The ADI falls apart above about +/-20 degrees of pitch</TD> 
 <TD>Texture cropping is not available yet for 2D cockpits</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
 <TD>The instrument panel is too small</TD>
 <TD>This is actually a feature :)  It is meant to increase 
     visibility over the nose.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
 <TD>T-38's don't have that instrument at the right side of the panel</TD>
 <TD>That's for flight test only.  If you don't want it there just comment
     out the "Aero data" instrument in T38-panel.xml.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
 <TD>Where's the cheezy AOA Christmas tree?</TD>
 <TD>Ignored for now.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
 <TD>The VOR doesn't work</TD>
 <TD>Working on it.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
 <TD>The altimeter digital readout is out of sync</TD>
 <TD>Rounding error.  A 'truncate' unary operator is needed.</TD>

<H3>Flying the T-38</H3>
Apply full throttle, afterburner is optional but recommended until 300 knots.  Rotate at 140 knots
.  When airborne raise gear and flaps immediately.  Be carefull not to sink after initial flap
 retraction. Climb at a shallow angle, less than 1000 fpm, until reaching 300 knots, then
climb at 300 knots to 0.8 Mach.  To land fly downwind at 300 knots clean, on base slow to
200 knots, extending gear and half flaps passing through 220 knots. On final
extend full flaps and slow to 160 knots.<BR><BR>
I recommend using the "hat switch" on your joystick to control stabilizer
trim.  I know most people like to use it for view changes, but you can't
fly a jet without lots of stab trimming.
<BR><BR>
Let me know if you'd like more features, and if you have recent time in the T-38
let me know if this model flies reasonably close to the real airplane.
<BR><BR>

<H3>Notes</H3>
The engine model uses the FGSimTurbine module of JSBSim.  The afterburner
can be activated in one of two ways, as defined by the AUGMETHOD value in
the engine configuration file.<BR><BR>
The "AOA buffet" sound activates at an AOA of 5.7 degrees.  The sound
should be a lower frequency buffet, and maybe I'll find the right sound 
someday.  As far as the activation AOA, it's only a guess.<BR><BR>
The light in the gear handle activates whenever throttle[0] is at idle
and the gear handle is up.  Not exactly how it works in the real airplane,
but close.<BR><BR>
