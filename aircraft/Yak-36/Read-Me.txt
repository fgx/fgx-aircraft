Yakovlev_Yak-36.


The global growing presence of the US navy in many parts of the world has urged the soviet governement to develop its navy's capabilities to oppose the american
domination of the world's oceans.So the Idea focused on building an airplane which can act in high subsonic speed from an aircraft carrier to provide support for
invasion troops, Anti-vessel attack, Diurnal attack against naval helicopters and transport aircrafts, besides attack against coastal targets.A limited number of
Yak-36 has been built to test VTOL manoeuvres and transitions between CTOL and VTOL states. The Yak-36 successful testings has led the soviet union to build the
Yak-38 Forger, a more developped VTOL airplane.        

Quick instructions:

CTOL_(Conventional take-off and landing):

Check the parking brake is off. Then throttle to 75%. Once you've reached 150,start piching-up. If the runway is too short you can throttle to 100% to take-off safely.
For making a smooth landing, reduce speed to 160 then pull back the stick a little bit when you're 10ft altitude so as the rear wheel can touch down first.
	
VTOL_(Vertical Take Off and landing):

Rotate the nozzles to 80 degrees and keep an eye on the NRI-Nozzle rotation indicator. Throttle to 70%. When you're at 80Ft or more,start decreasing the nozzles step by
step to 0 degree and at the same time stabilize the airplane by piching up and down.To make a safe transition from CTOL to a VTOL state you need to develop your skills a
bit more: When you're at 400FT altitude reduce throttle to 50%. Here you can rotate the nozzles to 95% to slow down the horizontal speed and to keep airplane in the air.
Speed reduced to 20, decrease the rotation to 85% and throttle-down step by step to land safely.This last manoeuvre is the most difficult one as you have to keep stabilizing
the airplane all the time.
