Model description and updates:

11/8/2002 - External model files added.

5/25/2002 - First release: v1-nl

* Despite its namesake, this is not intended to be a model of the
  Airwave Xtreme hang glider.  However, this hang glider has relatively
  high performance with a max L/D of approximately 12, which is in
  line with the Airwave Xtreme 150.

* Lift, drag and pitching moment is modeled from -180 to +180 deg.

* In longitudinal flight, moving the control bar fore and aft does two
  things simultaneously.  It changes the c.g. of the hang glider as well
  as the angle of attack of the wing.  This changes the lift, drag and
  moment about the c.g.  These effects are properly modeled.  The
  c.g. shift is not modeled for lateral directional flight, however.
  Instead a typical aileron is modeled for roll control.  Thus joystick
  position controls the fore/aft c.g. for pitch and "aileron" deflection
  for roll.

* Apparent mass effects are modeled, and this together w/ the c.g. shift
  both produce the characteristics hang glider landing dynamics -- big
  flares.

* Full aft c.g. (aft joystick) will put the hang glider in a vertical
  stable descent.  On average, the pitching moment characteristics of a
  hang glider lead to stable flight at near 90 deg angle of attack
  (vertical descent).  In real life unsteady vortex shedding would
  prevent stable flight in this regime.  This unsteadiness might be
  modeled in later versions.

* The aerodynamics are modeled after experimental data taken by
  Ormiston, R.A., "Wing Tunnel Tests of Four Flexible Wing Ultralight
  Gliders," NASA CP 2085, Part II, March 1979, pp 557-589.  These
  gliders are "vintage" hang gliders with more or less poor performance
  relative to modern hang gliders.  To better model current day hang
  gliders, some adjustments were made to the pitching moment and drag
  polar.  With the adjustment to the drag polar, the maximum L/D is now
  approximate 12.  Pitching moment data is discussed more below.

* Because a hang glider controls pitch with c.g. shift, the pitching
  moment curves are anything but linear.  This produces interesting
  aerodynamic control effects.  Most notably, at low speeds, it is
  relatively easy to pitch up the glider; whereas, at high speeds, the
  pitch up is slower.  Low speeds are experienced during landing, in
  particular the exaggerated flare.  High speeds can be had in a
  vertical dive.  Some adjustments were made to the experimental
  pitching moment data to more closely model the better handling of
  current hang gliders.  (If I can find a 3D model of an older
  lower-performance hang glider (1970 vintage), I will put back in the
  scary characteristics that led to many early hang glider accidents.)

* The hang glider simulation starts on the ground, and in real life
  there is no engine.  Because this is not real life, one of two things
  can be done to reach altitude.  Ctrl-U can be used to jump up in
  1000-ft increments.  Alternatively, an engine is included; add
  throttle and the hang glider will climb.
