README Aerospatiale AS332-L1, updated Version v20091214

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
THIS VERSION IS FOR TESTING PURPOSE ONLY
AND TO GIVE ME FEEDBACK VIA FORUM/EMAIL
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I started with FG some years ago and instead of putting an AS332 Superpuma to the wishlist of the community I decided to do it myself. This is my first aircraft development for FG. So please be aware of bugs/faults/crashes etc. This code is not >clean< and may cause problems. You use this at your own risk.

Most of Code for XML/NASAL-Files are taken from famous BO105 (Melchior Franz). FDM is from Maik Justus. FDM Configuration, 3d, Instruments etc. by HB-GRAL (some parts of instruments are taken from instruments of CVS). Current sounds are taken from bo105 (could not find sounds from a as332 yet).

BIG THANKS to Maik Justus and Heiko Schulz who helped me to get a better FDM.

Thank you for using this Version and to give me FEEDBACK and send your WISHES to
