The "AFN2" Instrument right of the compass can be adjusted 
via the "Radio" menu. If works as ADF reciever. The horizontal 
needle shows if the NDB is recieved, the vertical needle shows 
the course. Center it and you are on course. If the needle is 
left, turn left to center it again. If it's to the right turn 
right. 
 
The Livery Select Dialog is a modified version of AJs great Lightning 
Model. 
Drop your textures and a .xml file in the "Liveries" folder and it will 
show up in the Dialog (Great thanks to AJ for this).
