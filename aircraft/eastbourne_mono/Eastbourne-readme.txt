Eastbourne(YASim) readme. The model is based on my orginal Public Domain 1912 Eastbourne Monoplane .mqo model made in 2009 for the R/C flightsim Flying Model Simulator.

 Flight Data Model is YAsim, and I've added a few adjustments to the FDM .xml file to allow for slower engine rpm's and more overall airframe drag.  You're not going to get much more than 59 knots out of it at best.
