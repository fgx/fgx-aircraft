Note on RIO



Note on Ctrl-C

Hotspots and pick animation can be hilighted with Ctrl-c. Currently
(may 2010) a bug in FG makes part of the hilighting invisible. To have
them back, disable the shaders in the Rendering Options menu, you can
have alook at the totality of the hot-spots and switch back to the
shader rendering.

Weapons operation

ATM only the gun and the AIM-9s are operational, others ordonances are
displayed under the wing, their weight is correct but they aren't
usable.

Gun:
At startup, the ammunition store is filled with 675 round. It's not
possible to refill without quiting FG.
To fire the M61A1 Vulcan:
- Select HUD A/A Mode on the Display panel, on pilot's right console.
A multikey shortcut is also available (:AHa). Having the HUD in this
mode is not mandatory though there won't be any symbology available for
the gun in other HD modes.
- Select Gun mode with the Stick Weapon Mode Selector (w). A pipper,
the G symbol with a number showing aproximatly the remaining rounds
x 100 and a closure rate scale are displayed in the HUD. The closure
rate scale is active only if a target is locked by the radar with TWS
AUTO mode (diamond on the HUD).
- Switch Master Arm on, the X on the G symbol means Master Arm off or
in training mode. 
- Press e to fire the gun.  


Sidewinders:
Crudely modeled on AIM-9L available data.

- Select a weapons set using the menu: Tomcat Controls > Fuel and
Stores: "FAD light" has 4 sidewinders, "FAD", "FAD heavy" and "Bombcat"
have 2 of them.
- Select HUD A/A Mode on the Display panel, on pilot's right console.
A multikey shortcut is also available (:AHa).
- Select SW mode with the Stick Weapon Mode Selector (w).
- Switch to the back seater's view (Ctrl-v).
- Select pylons 1 and 8, down position, on the Armament panel, on RIO's
right console. A shortcut toggles these two switches so you can select
or deselect all AIM-9 in one keyboard stroke (Ctrl-m) without leaving
pilot's view.   
- Switch back to the pilot's view (Ctrl-v).
- Switch Master Arm on, you ear the search signal of the seeker
head, a low volume buzz sound.

- Now prior to be fired, the AIM-9 must have a lock on a target. For
the time being only Multiplayers and AI tankers can be locked. The
minimal lock distance is 10 NM, the target must be aproximately inside
a 80Â° cone centered on datum line. When locked, the signal buzz volume
becomes louder. For best results try to shoot at a 3 to 6 NM range and
with the target centered on the aircraft velocity vector.
The missile will explode at the smaller distance possible. However
if this distance is above 70 meters, it will continue its trajectory
without guidance.

 

Autopilot Operation

The main mode is Attitude Hold Mode, (Ctrl-t). Other Modes need this
main mode activated before being selected. Switching off Attitude Mode
disables all other modes. When in Attitude Mode, the autopilot
disengages whenever a certain pressure is put on the stick and it
reengages when the stick is back in the center position. Attitude Hold
Mode will hold pitch attitudes up to plus or minus 30 degrees, and bank
angles up to plus or minus 60 degrees. It shall be switched off for
aerobatics and inverted flight.



Autopilot Altitude Mode

Once in Attitude Mode, you can select Altitude Mode by hitting Ctrl-a,
then the AP REF indicator, (left of the VDI) will illuminate, when at
the desired altitude using normalstick control, engage by hitting *,
(asterix). The autopilot will then maintain your altitude.
CAUTION - at high speeds, it is imperative to stabilize the aircraft
prior to engage Altitude Mode.


Autopilot Heading Mode

Once in Attitude Mode, you can select Heading Mode by hitting Ctrl-h.
After manoeuvering the aircraft to the desired reference heading,
release the control stick at a bank angle of less than more or less 5
degrees. The autopilot will then hold the aircraft on the desired
Heading.

Autopilot need SAS channels to be engaged, (which is the default). SAS
Pitch and Roll channels may be disengaged by actuating switches located
on the AFCS panel.


Landing Automatic Power Control, (APC) Operation

The APC is a closed loop system that automaticaly regulates basic
engine thrust to maintain the aircraft at an optimum approach angle of
attack for landing. Prior to engage APC, gear handle must be down with
weight off wheels, and the throttles must be set between 98 percent rpm
and 68 percent rpm, (as shown on the panel gauges).
Type "a" to toggle the APC on off. APC is also disengaged by setting
the throttles to MIL, (98 percent rpm) or iddle, (68 percent rpm) or
raising the landing gear handle or when weight on wheels. 
When disengaged the AUTO THROT caution light, (on the left side of the
HUD) illuminates for 10 seconds.


Landing Direct Lift Control, (DLC) Operation

During landing approaches, the spoilers and horizontal stabilizers can
be controled simultaneously to provide glidepath correction without
changing powersetting or angle of attack.


Ground Spoilers Operation

Ground spoilers (that is elevons used as air-brake ) provide aditionnal
drag immediatly after touch down. Before landing, arm the ground
spoilers by hiting Ctrl-s. After the aircraft hit the runway pull the
throttle to idle, then the spoilers(elevons) get fully deployed. Hit
Ctrl-s again to disengage the ground spoilers.
