Airplane in this package is based on PA-22 model from year 1959 with original
instrument panel (in IFR configuration), full equipment (including arm rest :)
or AKO64 autopilot) and four original livery variants. The only exception from
the rule is radio panel which contains more up to date avionics with VOR and ADF
indicators placed there for better accessibility.

I would like to thank Pawel Luchowski for his great help in this project
(especially for creating electrical system and doors script). I would also like
to thank QF52 who helped me with tutorials. Last but not least would like to
thank all FlightGear community for inspiration. Many TriPacer's elements are
inspired or based on solutions found in such aircrafts as: bo105, c172p, dhc2, 
DR400 or pa24-250.
