Model description and updates:

11/10/2002 - Notes below added

* The Sopwith Camel did not have brakes.  Application of brakes in
  FGFS will cause the aircraft to promptly nose over.  (I have added a
  fake contact point so that the aircraft does not completely tip
  over.)  The c.g. of the aircraft sits almost directly above the
  wheel contact point.  There is a reason for this.  The aft fuselage
  and tail were designed to be very light.  Thus, the tail could not
  support much load, so the weight of the aircraft largely rests on
  the main wheels, which again requires the c.g. to be almost directly
  above the wheels.

* WWI aircraft engines did not have a conventional throttle (at least
  most did not).  The engines were either on or off/idle using a
  "blip-throttle".  So it is not realistic to fly with a variable
  throttle, which the current model allows.

* To modelers, I can provide a graphic showing the c.g. location.

* To those having specific knowledge of the Sopwith Camel, I am
  interested in obtaining the following data:

  [] Wing airfoil section

  [] RPM when the throttle is blipped.  I am currently using 300 RPM.
     The current aircraft uses a 150-hp Bentley B.R.1 engine, which is
     what Capt Brown was flying on the day when he claimed to kill the
     Baron von Richthofen (The Red Baron).

  [] Engine mass characteristics on a component-by-component basis.
     This information will help me refine the polar moment of inertia
     that drives the gyroscopic forces.

  [] On a related note, the mass of the propeller which also figures
     into the gyroscopic forces.

11/9/2002 - First release: v1-nl

* Motivation: FGFS and the UIUC aero model were used to develop flight
  models for both the Sopwith Camel and Fokker Dr.1 Triplane.  These
  models were then used in another simulation with a collaborator,
  Brian Fuesz.  In that simulation, guns, terrain, villages, multiple
  planes, etc were added to simulate the last flight of the Red Baron.
  This work was filmed for the Discovery Channel show "Unsolved
  History: The Death of the Red Baron" scheduled to first air Dec 18,
  2002.

* A.F. Scrub (af_scrubbypc@hotmail.com) has granted FlightGear
  permission to use and release the external model files with FlightGear
  under the GNU GPL.

* A weights and balance was performed to arrive at an allowable
  c.g. location and from that data, mass moments of inertia were
  calculated.

* Lift, drag and pitching moment data is modeled from -180 to +180
  deg.  In general, the aerodynamics are modeled using various
  sources.

* Apparent mass effects are modeled.

* Gyroscopic forces caused by engine rotation and aircraft rotations
  are modeled.  For an animation of how a WWI-type rotary engine works,
  go here:<a href="http://www.keveney.com/gnome.html">http://www.keveney.com/gnome.html</a>
  An example of gyroscopic forces, are those forces produced when one
  tries to rotate by hand a spinning bicycle wheel.

* Spin aerodynamics are not yet modeled.

* The simulation starts on the ground.  Throttle up to take off or
  alternatively, use Ctrl-U to jump up in 1000-ft increments.

* Interesting flight characteristics to note:

  - The Sopwith Camel was considered a "beast" to fly.  It killed 385
    pilots while they were in training (non-combat).  In combat, 415
    of the surviving pilots were killed while flying the Sopwith
    Camel.  Approximately 5000 Sopwith Camels were built, and it is
    believed that collectively 1294 enemy aircraft were destroyed.
    
  - In large part, the challenges to flying the Sopwith Camel involve
    the large gyroscopic forces from the rotating engine (which
    rotated clockwise when viewed from the cockpit).  Pulling nose up
    causes the aircraft to yaw to the right, yaw right and it noses
    down, nose down and it yaws left, yaw left and it noses up.  Thus
    whatever the direction the nose goes, the airplane slews to the
    right of that path.  This was particularly dangerous for
    right-hand turns if not properly managed.  The initial roll to the
    right takes place without any surprise.  But after having banked,
    pulling up elevator to turn causes the nose to "slew" to the right
    of the intended direction.  In this case, it leads to the nose
    pointing down, which in turn leads to a tail skid.  This skid
    could then easily precipitate into a spin.  Should that happen,
    the gyroscopic forces continue to do their work.  If control is
    recovered, during the pull out it is very easy to fly on the back
    side of the power curve.  If that happens, the pullout is very
    slow, and it is easy to auger-in.

  - As mentioned in the current sim, spin aerodynamics are not
    modeled, so the scenario just described will not happen.  However,
    the skidding is most apparent.  And it is quite easy to fly into
    the backside of the power curve from any flight attitude (there is
    ample "elevator power").  Keeping the speed up in general is one
    way to avoid this regime.

  - Rudder authority on the Sopwith Camel was inadequate, and it only
    increased the chances of spinning in.  Surely, the designers were
    aware of this fact, but a larger rudder would have led to more
    weight aft not only because of the shear mass of the tail, but
    also because of the larger structure required to support the
    larger airloads.  This solution surely countered the design
    philosophy of trying to put as much weight as possible between the
    pilot and engine, all in an attempted to increase maneuverability
    by keeping the moments of inertia as small as possible.

  - On takeoff, when the tail raises (nose down rotation) note the
    strong yaw to the left attributable to the gyroscopic forces.

  - In general, to stay coordinated in turns requires generous use of
    the rudder.
