NASA B-377SGT(Super guppy turbine)
-------------

Since a few months ago I read in the  flightgear forums that some guys were looking for this kind of airplanes which I'm interested in too.So,I took the decision to make some researches on the web and to start building it.I do not pretend this 3d model built with Blender2.49 represents the perfect shapes of the original guppy,that's why I encourage
any develloper in the flight gear community to create his own version using this 3d model
as a base . you can modify, add or remove anything in order to make an enhanced guppy if 
you are interested.There are also many guppies wating to be done like the Mini guppyMG,the 
Super guppySG,the pregnant guppy,or even their ancestor:the B-377 stratocruiser.

Enjoy
