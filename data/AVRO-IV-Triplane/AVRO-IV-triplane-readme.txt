AVRO-IV-triplane(YASim) readme. The model is based on my orginal Avroplane tripelane type I .mqo model made in 2003.

 Flight Data Model is YAsim and I've added adjustments to the FDM .xml file to allow for slower engine rpm's and more overall airframe drag.  You're not going to get much more than 44 knots out of it at best.
