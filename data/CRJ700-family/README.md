# Bombardier CRJ700 series

This is a project to develop the Bombardier CRJ700 regional jet for [FlightGear Flight Simulator](http://www.flightgear.org/).

It is already a highly complete and functional aircraft, with a realistic model, cockpit, and autopilot. Active development is effectively stopped and only bugfixes and regular maintenance are still being done.

Contributions and pull requests, of course, are welcome.

The latest CRJ700 is pushed out to [fgdata](https://gitorious.org/fg/fgdata/) before the next FlightGear release.
