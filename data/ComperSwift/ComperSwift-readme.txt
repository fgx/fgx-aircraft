Comper CLA7 Swift yasim readme.

This is not an authentic representation of a Comper CLA7 Swift
but it's based on the right numbers, where I could find them.

The actual aircraft modelled is G-ABUU (c/n S32/5) - C of A
first issued 08/04/1932.  The a/c was used as a company
demonstrator on an extensive European sales tour in April/May
1932 and was subsequently placed second in the 1933 King's
Cup race where it flew as number 26.

Notes
-----
There are no flaps on the Swift so I've re-bound the flap keys
'[/]' to adjust the view control, when sitting in the cockpit,
to shift the viewpoint left or right, to allow the pilot to see
what's in front of them.  While this works in the VC mode
(view 0), in other modes (chase etc.) it shifts the view up &
down.  This is to be resolved.

Afaik, the Swift had no brakes and relied upon it's low
approach speed and the rolling resistance of the LP tyres to
stop once on the ground.

Once the engine is running, you can either control the throttle
manually or via the AP.
