# McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30

This is a project to develop the McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 widebody transport and its deriratives for [FlightGear Flight Simulator](http://www.flightgear.org/).

It is effectively frozen in beta stage, as I have little time or motivation to devote to big projects like this. The aircraft currently features a complete model, FDM, and a highly realistic autopilot. The KC-10A also features working air-to-air refueling over multiplayer.

Contributions and pull requests, of course, are welcome.

The latest DC-10-30 is pushed out to [fgdata](https://gitorious.org/fg/fgdata/) before the next FlightGear release.
