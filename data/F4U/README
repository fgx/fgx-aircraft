The Corsair has a working tailhook, the Logo and number
are customizable by the properties "/sim/model/corsair/front"
and "/sim/model/corsair/number". There are some examples in
the directory "/corsair/Models/logos". Guns are triggered by setting
/controls/armament/trigger" to "true"

There is a long todo list on this aircraft, but it is fun to fly.

Enjoy and give feedback
