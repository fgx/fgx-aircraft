Fokker-Spin(YASim) readme. The model is based on Rien Cornielisson's orginal Public Domain 1911 Fokker Spin FS2004 .mdl model made in 2011 for the Haarlem celebration of Tony Fokker's historic flight.

 Flight Data Model is YAsim, and I've added adjustments to the FDM .xml file to allow for slower engine rpm's and more overall airframe drag.  You're not going to get much more than 53 knots out of it at best.
