INTRODUCTION
JT-5 is an aircraft designed by Jukka Tervamaki from Finland. 
The JT-5 is an improvement of an earlier design, Tervamaki's ATE-3, which did 
not have the "Constellation" tail, enclosed cockpit, or other composite components. 
The prototype JT-5 first flew on January 7,1973. Later Tervamaki sold it, 
along with productionrights, to Sr. Vittorio Magni in Italy. 
At least two other JT-5s are flying in Finland, and some 60 sets of plans have been sold.
