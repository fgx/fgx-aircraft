Thanks goes to Sopwith Camel's authors (AJ Macleod and Vivian Meazza). 
They kindly enough to let me use Camel's propeller 3D model, which is very close to K5Y1's one.
Plus, its beautifully textured propeller including hub and bolts saved many ohurs of labors.
Though I wanted to refer the 3D model instead of dupulicating it, the propeller needs to be 
180 degree rotated due to the spin direction of K5Y1 propeller is opposite to Camel's one.

I also want to thank BARANGER Emmanuel (a.k.a. helijah), and Syd Adams for their constant effort and 
building state-of-art works. Many of their aircraft give me hints directly and/or indirectly.
Plus, I reused the AI gauge and electrical.nas, some textures and instruments made for A6M2.
