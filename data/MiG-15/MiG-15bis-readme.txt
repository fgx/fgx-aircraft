For startup and understanding of aircraft please read documentation in /Documentation directory.

2) From simply Korean-like model paint to authentic Soviet Russia paint.
3) From Yasim model with weird stalls to JSBSim model with aerial dynamic data from real MiGs.
4) From common sounds to closed to real and real sounds.
5) From absence of documentation to full documentation in pdf.
6) From unreal fuel system to closed to real system with balance tank and external drop tanks.
7) From "dummy" to "real" weapons for warfare addon.
