This is second version of model An-2 for FlightGear. It intend for replace old version of An-2. Old model was full re-done, deep reconstructed FDM and equipment. We use new visual model by A.Yemelianov aka DUST. Unfortunatelly, external model not textured yet.

Installation:

1. Unzip archive into your home dir. If you read this file, seems you do it already:)
2. Backup old version (FG_ROOT/Aircraft/an2).
3. Remove old FG_ROOT/Aircraft/an2.
4. Copy/move/symlink new model dir into FG_ROOT/Aircraft/an2.

Model has autostart procedure - simple press "s" button. Internal views selects by press 1 or 2, like Tu-154b. Unlike real life, you can use simple autopilot by press F11 key.

Model has realistic engine heating and air cooling control. You should control dampers for cylinder heads and oil cooler by two 3-position switch on central panel. There is an oil damper position gauge on piedestal, cylinder heads and oil termometers on captain panel. Pilot can see position of cylinder dampers via canopy. In real life, engine will failure, if you not hold temperature properly. In current version of an-2, this feature disabled now.
