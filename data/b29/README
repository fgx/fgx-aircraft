At the moment this airplane is under heavy develpoment. The FDM is flyable but
does not reflect the performance of the real world aircraft. The 3D model is
also incomplete. Most of the parts are there, but many animations are missing
and there is a lot of tweaking of materials, object order and grouping to be
done. Instrumentation is finally done, but clickable panels are just getting
started.

For more information see the files changelog, stuff/NOTES and stuff/TODO.
