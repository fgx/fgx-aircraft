=====================
2005-Jun-11

Added switches for nav lights and landing lights with hotspots. Also included
NASAL to drive the landing light behavior.

Minor changes to some cockpit objects in the .ac file.

Added NASAL to make the p-brake behave more realistically. You now have to depress the pedals
before putting on the brake for it to stick, and touching the brakes also turns the brake off.

Finished landing gear light material animation.

Animated cowl and intercooler flaps (that was a chore)

Added rudimentary AI to simulate the engineer controlling the cowl and intercooler flaps.

Fixed the tail insignia for "Lucky Lady", now a circle as in real life.

More minor model and texturing changes.

=====================
2005-Jun-20

Made new custom ASI.

Made more changes to cabin interior.

=====================
2005-Jun-27

Added the cockpit floor hatch and animated it. It's quite attractive.

Made some adjustments to the struts on the canopy

Added tail gunner's gunsight

Made changes to the .ac postprocessor to easily add custom crease angles and overwrite materials.

Fixed the landing gear light behavior by adding a master safe to land light and removing the tailskid light.

Added some more struts to the MLG, tweaked the wheel well for more realism and so they'd fit.

Installed a new gyro compass dial.

Install a new mag compass dial.

Added multiple pilot views. Access via 'j' (for jump) key.

Added flaps position indicator.

=====================
2005-Jul-01

Cleaned up controls.flapsDown function overload.

Animated flaps switch and added clickable zones.


=====================
2005-Jul-25

Animated boost dial and added boost hostspots to panel.

Added MP and RPM guages.

Added the blind landing indicator.

=====================
2005-Jul-29

Added attitude indicator, complete with cageing knob and flag animations.

Added PDI instrument. It doesn't do anything yet, because there is no bombing
AI.

Animated crew entry ladder.

Added Flux Gate Compass instrument.

Added the Radio Compass. It is implemented as a simple ADF without a rotating
dial.

Remodeled Mag Compass to be more historically accurate.

Remodeled Heading Indicator to be more historically accurate.

Cut holes in pilot panels and did away with old temporary alpha channel panel.

=====================
2006-Feb-03

Remodeled pilot's and bombadier's seats to be more accurate.

Added a control box for the ADF, with animated dial.

Started a basic b29-sound.xml file. Much more to come.

Applied Vivian's engine changes (Thanks Vivian!) and made some adjustments to the FDM config.

Added noshadow animations for a multitude of objects.

Finally fixed the prop animations. They fade in/out, are layered over the engines and each other correctly and of course spin. No prop pitch though, that's just too much work for now.

Added more detail to the brake pedal animation.

Repaired main gear animation.


=====================
2006-Mar-20

Enlarged Bomb Bay.

Added two bomb loadaouts, both the models and the data for the weights.

Started a set of nasal calls to drop bombs and handle the animation/submodel triggers, as well as to update the YASim weights.

Started a submodel configuration for both loadouts.

Nasalized the view offset and fov control so that you zoom in on the pilot's head, but zoom out to the ac's cg. There's even a special mode that centers on the bomb bay when the doors open!

Chromed some fixtures in the cockpit.
