To run, try:

fgfs --aircraft=marchetti-v1-uiuc

Files and directory structure required in $FG_ROOT/Aircraft/ to fly the
model:

marchetti-v1-uiuc-set.xml
marchetti/Sounds/uiuc/marchetti-sound.xml
UIUC/marchetti-v1/aircraft.dat

These files above come with the FlightGear base package.

A 3D model of this aircraft does not yet exist.

Nevertheless, various 3D models can be obtained from Wolfram Kuss'
website here:

Model description and updates:

9/7/02 - Added in more moment to trim at cruise.  Made some slight
         changes to gear parameters.

5/27/02 - First release: v1

* "Linear model" meaning that constants are use for stability
  derivatives.  The chief drawback of this type of model is that stall
  is not properly modeled, and as a consequence an unrealistically
  high lift coefficient is produced when the aircraft is at a high
  angle of attack.  As a result the aircraft can fly much more slowly
  than in real life.

* This particular aircraft has an instability when the nose is pushed
  over with down elevator.  This instability is a consequence of using
  the linear aerodynamics approximation.

* Model largely built from: "Small twin turboprop commuter airplan"
  data from: Roskam, J., Airplane Flight Dynamics and Automatic Flight
  Controls, Part I, DARcorporation, Lawrence, KS, 1995, pg 508-510.
