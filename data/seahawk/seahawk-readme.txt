SeaHawk yasim readme.

This is not an authentic representation of a Sea Hawk but it's
based on the right numbers, where I could find them, and then
hacked to be flyable.

The parking brake will open the cockpit canopy and fold the wings.
Do not attempt to do this in flight or you will crash (I get a
seg fault;)

The model was originally constructed in Realsoft3D (linux beta
V4.5) and then exported as .3ds.

The seahawk-yasim-set.xml file includes references to the
a4-sound.xml file.  Two Panels have been included - a full panel,
which imposes a frame-rate hit on my system, and a mini panel,
which seems to run ok.

The autopilot is quite aggressive and can cause elevator
'hunting' at low speeds < approx 230 asi.
