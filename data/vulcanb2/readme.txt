A. V. Roe Vulcan B.2
====================

The Avro Vulcan was probably the most famous of the U.K. V-force aircraft,
originally deisgned to deliver atomic weapons in the early 1950s. A huge
four-engined, subsonic delta bomber, it was originally designed for high-level
delivery. Due to improvements in Russion AA technology, the V-force was
re-trained for low-level flying, for which the Vulcan proved to have a much more
robust airframe than the Victor or Valiant.

While being retired for service in 1982 (to be replaced by the Tornado), the
Vulcan was finally used in anger during the Falklands Conflict. The "Black Buck"
missions flew flew from Ascension Island to bomb Port Stanley runway and take
out anti-aircraft radar systems. At the time, the mission was the longest
bombing mission ever undertaken and involved incredible logistics and multiple
in-flight refueling from Victor aircraft.

This FlightGear Vulcan models 3 specific aircraft:

XM597 - Used in Black Buck 5 & 6. Armed with 4 Shrike anti-radar 
air-to-ground missiles, plus a Dash-10 ECM pod. It now resides at The Museum of Flight in East
Fortune, Scotland.

XM603 - Painted in anti-flash white colours of the late 1960s. Armed with a
Red Beard nuclear bomb of that era. Now at the Avro Heritage Trust in Woodford.

XM607 - The most famous Vulcan - used in Black Buck 1 & 2. Armed with 21 1,000lb bombs, plus a Dash-10 
ECM pod. Now at RAF Waddington.

You can swap between them within FlightGear using the Configuration menu (TAB key). This also allows
you to specify the armament as you wish.

Note that the Blue Steel missile was designed to fall clear of the aircraft before firing, hence
it simply drops from the bomb bay. Unfortunately the currently limitations in sub-models
mean that we cannot model the firing sequence.

Systems
=======

The Vulcan has 4 engines, airbrakes, a brake chute, and no flaps.

V-speeds can be found in the Aircraft Help within FG.

Acknowledgments
===============

Jonathan Harris very kindly GPL'd his X-plane Vulcan which this model is based
upon.

AJ for the Lighning, which I borrowed many dials and JSBSim code from.

Jon Stockill for the XM602 re-paint and nuclear weapons other than Red Beard.

Lee Elliott for the Red Beard bomb I've copied from the Canberra.


To Do
=====
- Cockpit - Many of the dials are from the Lightning and so cover very high
            speeds.
- Fuel System - I've simplified the fuel system from 14 tanks to 4. The fuel
                system is very complex and needs it's own panel
- Airbrakes - These have been simplified too. They should have two positions
              35 and 55 degrees, with the 55 degrees becoming 85 when
              the undercarriage is down
- Electrical - There is currently no electrical system
- Textures   - They look pretty rough, don't they...
