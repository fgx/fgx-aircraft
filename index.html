  </h2>

  <p>
   Theo pointed the way to load Three.js json models (3js) into a global scene. The initial, very
   manual way to get this 3js was to load the flightgear ac3d (.ac) model into blender, then
   export it as dae, then load that dae and export it as 3js. It works, but is quite cumbersome.
   And the blender UI take some understanding...
  </p>

  <p>
   I had already started experiments with some ac3d2gl sources. That is load an ac3d model file
   and render it in GL. And the source of these experiments are in my fgtool repo -
   <a href="http://gitorious.org/fgtools/ac3d2gl">http://gitorious.org/fgtools/ac3d2gl</a> - but
   this only started to identify the problems... While MOST ac3d *.ac files list all faces with 3
   (or 4) vertices, some like say the fg 707.ac have faces with 64 vertices! How to render these
   in GL?
  </p>

  <p>
   My next attempt was in a project called ac2glview ( TODO -
   <a href="http://gitorious.org/fgtools/ac2glview">http://gitorious.org/fgtools/ac2glview</a> ).
   Here I developed an ac3d_browser2 program which loads an ac3d *.ac file, shows a GL view, and
   lists the components. Each component can be expanded in the list, selected, and an attempt is
   made to give a GL view of that single item. And, if not needed in the final model, like light
   cones, wheels, other artifacts, they can be deleted, and a cleaned .ac files written.
  </p>

  <p>
   To this program I also added the ability to 'export' the model directly to 3js, and while this
   works well for a large number of model files, it fails when any of the faces contains more than
   3 or 4 vertices. Lots of effort was put into solving this, but could not get it right...
  </p>

  <p>
   I messed around with some other sources, like
   <a href="http://mview.sourceforge.net/">mview</a>, which supports a considerable list of 3D
   formats - <a href="http://www.ipab.informatics.ed.ac.uk/mvu/">PMesh</a>,
   <a href="http://gts.sourceforge.net/">GTS</a>, <a href="http://www.geomview.org/">OFF/COFF</a>,
   <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/">ply</a>,
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VRML">VRML 1/2</a>, shallo?,
   <a href="http://www.vtk.org/">vtk</a> and
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file">obj</a>. But on reviewing most of
   these again all faces have 3 vertices, and in some rare cases 4. Never values like 64!
  </p>

  <p>
   This track led me deeper into the <a href="http://www.geomview.org/">geomview</a> (OFF/COFF)
   source, but while it compiles and runs well in Ubuntu linux, it proved too difficult to compile
   in Windows. It is too mixed up with Motif and X11!
  </p>

  <p>
   By chance I ran across assimp (
   <a href="http://assimp.sourceforge.net/">http://assimp.sourceforge.net/</a> ). To quote from
   their websit "<strong>Open Asset Import Library</strong> (short name: Assimp) is a portable
   Open Source library to import various well-known 3D model formats in a uniform manner. The most
   recent version also knows how to export 3d files and is therefore suitable as a general-purpose
   3D model converter.". And added to that it supports 'scripting' of the load, post processing
   and exporting...
  </p>

  <p>
   Naturally the loading included ac3d *.ac model files, but it only exported
   <a href="http://collada.org/">dae</a>,
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file">obj</a>,
   <a href="http://www.stereolithography.com/exporting-stl-files.php">stl</a> and
   <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/">ply</a>. But I knew one of these must
   have the same constraints as 3js, namely ALL faces must be described as 'triangles', that is
   sets of 3 vertices. So I copied the 'obj' exporter, and changed the code to output 3js, AND IT
   WORKED ;=))
  </p>

  <p class="nmb">
   So then we have the action chain -
  </p>

  <ol class="nmt">
   <li>load the model into ac3d_browser2
   </li>

   <li>review and delete unwanted components if any
   </li>

   <li>write a modified new *.ac file
   </li>

   <li>load that ac file into assimp_viewer
   </li>

   <li>exort as 3js
   </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
   And bingo we have the desired web 3js model file. Some of this process is aided by the fact
   that both programs, ac3d_browser2 and assimp. On exit ac3d_browser2 will generate a 'script' to
   repeat the process, whihc includes a script to run assimp and export the 3js. Namely the last
   two steps listed above.
  </p>

  <p>
   So excluding the manual review step 2, I was able to create a big list of FG model ac file -
   aclist-ac.txt - and use a batch file to process them ALL. This gave me a set of 435 3js files
   to load and view. They range in size from the small 5,310 byte
   <a href="ac/paperairplane.js">paperairplane.js</a>, to the massive 73,155,108 byte
   <a href="ac/Vostok-1-TDU.js">Vostok-1-TDU.js</a>

  <ul class="nmt">
