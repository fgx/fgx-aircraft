## Concept
The objective of this project is to make available as [Three.js JSON] ( https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/JSON-Model-format-3.1 ) files all the aircraft and other 3D models that are created for FlightGear.

As Three.js JSON files the aircraft may be easily displayed and manipulated in a browser.

Here is a trypical example of the code:

[Santos-Dumont 14bis]( http://fgx.github.io/fgx-aircraft/aircraft/14bis/14bis.js )

All the aircraft have a GPL 2 license and and may be linked to from this project.

A longer term objective might be to accept models from any source and create a virtual museum of flyable aircraft.

Latest revision of aircraft viewer: [Fgx Aircraft Viewer R2]( http://fgx.github.io/fgx-aircraft/aircraft-viewer/r2/aircraft-viewer.html )

You have two ways of viewing the FGx Aircraft files:  

* Code hosted on GitHub: [fgx.github.io/fgx-aircraft]( http://fgx.github.io/fgx-aircraft/ "view the files as apps." ) <input value="<< You are now probably here." size=28 style="font:bold 12pt monospace;border-width:0;" >  
* Source code on GitHub: [github.com/fgx/fgx-aircraft/]( https://github.com/fgx/fgx-aircraft/ "View the files as source code." ) <scan style=display:none ><< You are now probably here.</scan>


### System Requirements
In order to view the files on this site you will need a device and browser that provides good support for [WebGL](http://get.webgl.org/)
WebGL is the JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D graphics and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. 

Generally this means a computer with an Intel Core i5 processor with an external GPU such as one made by Nvidia. 
Successful use of the apps on a phone or tablet is highly unlikely. 
A mouse or other pointing device with a scroll wheel is also highly recommended so that you can zoom, pant and rotate in 3D.

The apps here may work in the FireFox browser, but most likely will not work with Safari or Internet Explorer. 
The apps here are currently being and tested with the Google Chrome browser. 
Bugs on browsers other than Chrome need not be reported until such as the work settles down and an effort to support more browsers is initiated.
