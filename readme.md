FGx Aircraft 
============

Latest revision of aircraft viewer: [Fgx Aircraft Viewer R2](http://fgx.github.io/fgx-aircraft/aircraft-viewer/r2/aircraft-viewer.html)

## Project Links

You have two ways of viewing the FGx Aircraft files:  

* Code hosted on GitHub: [fgx.github.io]( http://fgx.github.io/fgx-aircraft "view the files as apps." ) <input value="<< You are now probably here." size=28 style="font:bold 12pt monospace;border-width:0;" >  
* Source code on GitHub: [github.com/fgx]( https://github.com/fgx/fgx-aircraft/ "View the files as source code." ) <scan style=display:none ><< You are now probably here.</scan>


### System Requirements
In order to view the files on this site you will need a device and browser that provides good support for [WebGL](http://get.webgl.org/)
WebGL is the JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D graphics and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. 

Generally this means a computer with an Intel Core i5 processor with an external GPU such as one made by Nvidia. 
Successful use of the apps on a phone or tablet is highly unlikely. 
A mouse or other pointing device with a scroll wheel is also highly recommended so that you can zoom, pant and rotate in 3D.

The apps here may work in the FireFox browser, but most likely will not work with Safari or Internet Explorer. 
The apps here are currently being and tested with the Google Chrome browser. 
Bugs on browsers other than Chrome need not be reported until such as the work settles down and an effort to support more browsers is initiated.



### Aircraft Road Map
* Meld duplicate vertices and redefine normals for each aircraft using Blender. Perhaps can build Python utility to help
* Ascertain original scale and rescale planes so they are all at the same scale
* Point all planes in the same direction
* Agree a suitable base point (the nose or most forward point of the body of an aircraft?) and apply to each aircraft
* Create directories for each plane
* Add thumbnails, license and original authors notes for each plane
* Add readme for each plane with link to source in fgdata on Gitorious
* Investigate adding Livery bitmaps


### Aircraft Viewer Road Map
* Add slide-show replay capability
* Add pre-loading of next file
* Camera movement starts of no user interaction for 20 seconds.
* Start adding limited piloting capabilities
